# Gilfoyle-BTC-alert
-Alerts user when Bitcoin reaches a certain price target.  
-Theres 2 functions making 2 price target alerts.  
-You need to download Napalm-death 'you suffer' and copy the file path to both functions (Get-bitcoinPrice, and Get-BitcoinPrice2)
-I can only confirm this works on WINDOWS 10 and windows media player (wmp)  No other OS or music player was tested
-You can add more functions for different price levels (add Get-bitcoinPrice3, 4, 5, 6 ect..) 
-You can skew the code however needed.  this is the only way I thought of, but I'm sure their are more ways for the same output. (don't feel like doing regex rn..)
-You can skew the code in the functions to do ranges and increase the query time too, I only made this to my liking.
